# Statistics for Forensic Practitioners

An asynchronous online course for forensic practitioners to learn about introductory probability and statistics.

I was tasked with developing the assessments, both formative and summative, for the course.
I also recorded a lecture video for Part 7 of the course that covered quadratic and logistic regression.

# Content

Each folder contains material that I personally authored.

Most of the folders contain assignments labeled "quiz" or "lab."
These are formative, ungraded assignments that students use to check their understanding of the lecture content.
The quizzes cover the "conceptual" material for the course - for example, can a student properly calculate a conditional expectation using Bayes' Rule?
The labs apply the lecture content to analyze forensic or criminological data in Excel.
Solutions for the quizzes and labs are provided to students along with the original assignments.

I also authored the final exam and study materials.
The study materials include a practice final exam that is similar to the actual final exam.
The "Final Exam" folder includes these study materials, but not the actual final exam.

The Part 7 folder contains a pdf of slides that I created for the my part of the lecture.
