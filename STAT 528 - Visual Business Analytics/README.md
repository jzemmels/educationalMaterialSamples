# STAT 528 - Visual Business Analytics

An asynchronous online course offered to [Master's of Business Analytics](https://www.ivybusiness.iastate.edu/degree/mban/) students at Iowa State University.
The focus of the course is on data visualization techniques and tools, which an emphasis on creating visualizations and interactive web applications using the tidyverse R packages.
I taught the course in Fall 2022.

# Content

Part of the course's final project requires students to create an interactive web application using the shiny R package.
The previous course instructor, Dr. Heike Hofmann, proposed adding new content covering additional shiny functionality.
I created the "Shiny App Tutorial" to guide students in finding, analyzing, and summarizing a data set for their final project.
This folder includes an Rmarkdown file that I created to explore an example data set of liquor sales in Iowa as well as a shiny application script to summarize the data set.
