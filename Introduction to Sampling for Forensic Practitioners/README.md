# Introduction to Sampling for Forensic Practitioners

A 6-hour short course covering probabilistic sampling methods offered by the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence.

I was tasked with creating a course "practicum" that applied concepts covered in the course to analyzing forensic data.
I also created a "Stats Starter" to introduce forensic practitioners to sample size calculation methods.

The "Practicum" is divided into two parts.
Part 1 uses a data set containing elemental concentrations of Mangenese-55 in panes of glass to explore how various sampling procedures affect estimates for the population mean.
Part 2 uses an Excel-based sample size calculator developed at the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes to explore Hypergeometric and Bayesian sample size calculation methods.

The "Stats Starter" is intended as a one-pager to introduce a statistical/probabilistic concept to forensic practitioners.
The Stats Starter folder contains two versions of the document: the "draft" is a mock-up that I created and the "editedDraft" was created by designers at CSAFE based on my mock-up.
